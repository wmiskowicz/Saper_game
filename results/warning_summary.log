----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_redraw_board/u_top_draw_num/u_check_char_board/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_redraw_board/u_top_draw_num/u_check_char_board/data_reg[49]_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_redraw_board/u_top_draw_num/u_check_char_board/data_reg[49]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
