----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-689] width (32) of port connection 'a_in' does not match port width (7) of module 'multiplier' [rtl/draw/top_redraw_board/mine/draw_mine.sv:63]
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_easy_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_medium_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_hard_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:450]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.x_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:456]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:514]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.y_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:520]
WARNING: [Synth 8-87] always_comb on 'button_index_x_nxt_reg' did not result in combinational logic [rtl/game/top_mine/detect_index.sv:52]
WARNING: [Synth 8-87] always_comb on 'button_index_y_nxt_reg' did not result in combinational logic [rtl/game/top_mine/detect_index.sv:53]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port in\.button_num[4] in module detect_index is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port in\.button_num[3] in module detect_index is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port in\.button_num[2] in module detect_index is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port in\.button_num[1] in module detect_index is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port in\.button_num[0] in module detect_index is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port clk100MHz in module top_mouse is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-327] inferring latch for variable 'button_index_x_nxt_reg' [rtl/game/top_mine/detect_index.sv:52]
WARNING: [Synth 8-327] inferring latch for variable 'button_index_y_nxt_reg' [rtl/game/top_mine/detect_index.sv:53]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_top_mouse/u_MouseCtl/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_top_mouse/u_MouseCtl/button_index_x_nxt_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_top_mouse/u_MouseCtl/button_index_x_nxt_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
