----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_easy_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_medium_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_hard_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:450]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.x_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:456]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:514]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.y_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:520]
WARNING: [Synth 8-3848] Net pclk in module/entity top_vga_basys3 does not have driver. [fpga/rtl/top_vga_basys3.sv:44]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
