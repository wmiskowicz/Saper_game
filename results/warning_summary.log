----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_easy_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_medium_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-5856] 3D RAM num_arr_hard_reg  for this pattern/configuration is not supported. This will most likely be implemented in registers
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:450]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.x_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:456]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:514]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.y_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:520]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met

----IMPLEMENTATION----
CLEAR :)
